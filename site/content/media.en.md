## About the Initiative

The **Public Money? Public Code!** campaign aims to set Free Software as the standard for publicly financed software. It has been started in autumn 2017 with an open letter which has been signed {{< count type="signatures" >}} individuals and {{< count type="organisations" >}} organisations. The campaign raises awareness of the importance of licencing decisions and helps public administrations gain full control of their digital infrastructure in order to establish trustworthy systems.

The campaign is lead by the **[Free Software Foundation Europe](https://fsfe.org) (FSFE)**. The FSFE is a charity that empowers users to control technology. Founded in 2001 as a non-profit, non-governmental organisation and network, it is itself part of a global network of people with common goals and visions. The FSFE is supported by its members from all over Europe and has regional chapters in eleven countries. The central component of the FSFE's work is keeping the legal, political, and social base of Free Software strong, secure, and free of particular interests.
